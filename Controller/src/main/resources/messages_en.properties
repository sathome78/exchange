dashboard.termsContent=<p>1. About the project</p>\
<p>EXRATES.ME (hereinafter - "the exchange") is used to create all possible conditions for providing a convenient exchange of funds specified in the "Your balance" section of the account by entering, creating orders and withdrawing funds of exchange transactions participants (hereinafter - "the client").</p>\
<p>The exchange undertakes to take all possible measures to protect the funds of our customers and to provide an opportunity to trade and withdraw them without any restrictions.</p>\
<p>The exchange provides support to our users to resolve any difficulties associated with the operation of the exchange.</p>\
<p>The support is available in the "Support" section.</p>\
<p>2. Registration Rules</p>\
<p>In order to take advantage of the exchange functionality, it is necessary to register.</p>\
<p>Required fields for filling in the registration form are:</p>\
<p>login, containing at least;</p>\
<p>password;</p>\
<p>valid e-mail.</p>\
<p>The registration procedure provides confirmation of the efficiency of the indicated electronic address, by sending a specialized link for authorizing the registered account.</p>\
<p>After the registration is completed, all sections of the exchange are available to the client.</p>\
<p>3. Trading Rules</p>\
<p>Trades with the specified currencies or virtual title signs (cryptocurrencies) are carried out by filling orders for the purchase or sale of such signs through the "Trades" interface by specifying the amount of purchase or sale and the desired rate.</p>\
<p>After the creation of the order on the currency pair, the search for the counter-orders with the same rate is automatically performed, and if such are found, the transaction is automatically closed.</p>\
<p>If the order was not automatically closed by the transaction or was partially closed by counter-orders - this order or the part thereof remains active until the corresponding counter-order appears.</p>\
<p>If the purchase rate in the order is specified higher than the current sales order, the transaction will be made at the rate of the current sales order. For example, if an order is created for the purchase of BTC at the rate of 1000, and in the current orders there will be a warrant for sale at 950, the transaction will be executed at the rate of 950. The same works for sale: if the selling rate is lower than the current order rate, the transaction will be carried out at the rate of the current purchase order.</p>\
<p>Your current orders can be canceled at any time. Completed orders can not be canceled.</p>\
<p>The commission accounts for 0.2% of incoming funds from the transactions.</p>\
<p>You agree not to complain or harass any person or organization for any loss of funds due to incorrect entry of the price, the indication of an incorrect address for withdrawal or other actions that you have taken or not taken, and also due to actions of others, the inaccessibility of the website or system failures.</p>\
<p>4. The policy of trading volume and the removal of coins</p>\
<p>We begin to track the daily turnover of the coin 3 months after it was added to the stock exchange. If the average daily turnover for the last month does not exceed 0.2 BTC - we announce the removal of such a coin in the "News" section on the main trading interface. After the announcement of the removal, we will leave the coin on the exchange for at least 2 more weeks to trade or withdraw. If the average daily turnover during this period exceeds 0.2 BTC - the coin will remain on the exchange.</p>\
<p>5. Round-off rules</p>\
<p>Round-off in relation to all calculated amounts is carried out to 8 decimal places in favor of the exchange.</p>\
<p>6. Rules of cryptocurrency replenishment and withdrawal</p>\
<p>Cryptocurrencies are replenished by sending the desired amount to the address generated by the exchange for the user. Such addresses are generated on the request "New address" in the "Finance" section.</p>\
<p>A large number of deposits of very small fractional parts of coins or mining directly to the stock exchange address from the pool with small fractional parts of coins will be treated as transactions spam and can lead to account blocking without any compensation. We recommend to mine to the local wallet, and from there, if necessary, send it to the stock exchange.</p>\
<p>The cryptocurrency withdrawal is carried out via the "Funds withdrawal" interface of the "Finance" section by specifying the address to which the available amount of a certain cryptocurrency should be sent.</p>\
<p>Replenishment and withdrawal work in automatic mode and is initiated instantly. All possible delays in the transfer of funds after a successful withdrawal are independent of the exchange. Successful withdrawal of funds is always confirmed by the identifier of the outgoing transaction. We are not responsible for deposits made from "incorrect fork" or with errors in the wallet or the blockchain leading to the actual absence of coins.</p>\
<p>8. Rules for the fiat funds replenishment and withdrawal</p>\
<p>Fiat funds are replenished through the "Refill" interface of the "Fiat funds" subsection of the "Finance" section.</p>\
<p>It is possible to withdraw available financial means through the interface "Funds withdrawal" of the "Fiat funds" subsection in the "Finance" section. The deadline for fiat funds withdrawal is up to 48 hours.</p>\
<p>9. Rules of recording the history of operations</p>\
<p>We guarantee the display of detailed transaction history for the last 3 months. All operations older than 3 months can be archived and turned to consolidated records.</p>\
